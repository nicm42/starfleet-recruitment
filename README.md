# starfleet-recruitment

A website for Starfleet recruitment.

I created this to practise LESS, which I recently learnt. I also tried out creating a carousel-like thing, using LESS and JS. I also used a hero image, a form and a fixed-position menu that folds out on click.

I like LESS, it makes the CSS less repeating and more like a programming language in the use of functions. At first thoughts the carousel was hard, but upon thinking about it, it was pretty easy to establish how to get it to work.
